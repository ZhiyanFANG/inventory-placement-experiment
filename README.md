Code of Chapter 6: Numerical Experiments in the Master Thesis of Zhiyan FANG, Institute of Operations Research and Analytics, National University of Singapore.

These experiments are conducted to compare the performance of our proposed Guaranteed-Delay Replenishment Model (GDRM) and one typical traditional model (Graves and Willems, 2003). The bulldozer supply chain for experiments is shown as below.
